Reddit Image Crawler
====================

Gets the hot posts from your favourite subreddit and puts them in a nice show in an html document.

How to use:
-----------
- run imageCrawl.py from your terminal (python imgCrawler.py)
- Choose the values and subreddit you want
- open index.html
- enjoy your images!

(you need praw to use this, use pip install praw if you don't have it) 

P.S. I recommend getting images from /r/earthporn (not actually porn)
